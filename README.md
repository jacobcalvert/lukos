# Learning uKernel Operating System (LuKOS)
This repo contains the all design throughts and implementation of what I'm calling LuKOS. This project is purely for me to explore microkernel implementation on modern architecutures. You'll find the design documents in the design directory, and the implmenetation source in the implementation directory. 

## Goals
[ ] Understand what makes a microkernel different in practice than a monolithic kernel
[ ] Understand some of the pros and cons of a microkernel
[ ] Design and implement a basic microkernel with some services
[ ] Have fun!
